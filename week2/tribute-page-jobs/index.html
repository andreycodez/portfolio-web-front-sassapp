            Schieble became pregnant with Jobs in 1954, when she and Jandali spent the summer with his 
            family in Homs, Syria. According to Jandali, Schieble deliberately did not involve him in 
            the process: "without telling me, Joanne upped and left to move to San Francisco to have 
            the baby without anyone knowing, including me."
